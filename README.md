cut_fvcom:   Cut a fvcom output file from lon/lat limits and import it using PyFVCOM package. Sometimes I have used this to decrease the time processing of large fvcom output files

delete_vectors:   When plotting fvcom velocities, some vectors are too big and overlap others, this script delete vectors by a specified magnitude.
